Quantum Monte Carlo for the harmonic oscillator

Jupyter python notebooks highlighting two ground state (T=0) methods:

1. Variational Monte Carlo (VMC)
2. Path Integral Ground State Monte Carlo (PIGS)

These codes were originally written as part of a series of lectures presented
at the 2018 [National Magnet Lab Winter Theory
School](https://nationalmaglab.org/news-events/events/for-scientists/winter-theory-school) and are intended to be pedagogical at the expense of any and all efficiency.
These should be treated as *toy* codes.  Statistical uncertainties are
approximated via the standard error and ignore all correlations between
measurements.  These are likely to underestimate the error in the data.
